;;; Commentary:

;; Elpher aims to provide a practical and friendly gopher and gemini
;; client for GNU Emacs.  It supports:

;; - intuitive keyboard and mouse-driven browsing,
;; - out-of-the-box compatibility with evil-mode,
;; - clickable web and gopher links *in plain text*,
;; - caching of visited sites,
;; - pleasant and configurable colouring of Gopher directories,
;; - direct visualisation of image files,
;; - a simple bookmark management system,
;; - gopher connections using TLS encryption,
;; - the fledgling Gemini protocol,
;; - the greybeard Finger protocol.

;; To launch Elpher, simply use 'M-x elpher'.  This will open a start
;; page containing information on key bindings and suggested starting
;; points for your gopher exploration.

;; Full instructions can be found in the Elpher info manual.

;; Elpher is under active development.  Any suggestions for
;; improvements are welcome, and can be made on the official
;; project page, gopher://thelambdalab.xyz/1/projects/elpher/.
