Elpher
======

Elpher aims to provide a full-featured gopher client for GNU Emacs.

It supports:
- intuitive keyboard and mouse-driven browsing,
- out-of-the-box compatibility with evil-mode,
- clickable web and gopher links **in plain text**,
- caching of visited sites,
- pleasant and configurable visualization of Gopher directories,
- direct visualisation of image files,
- jumping directly to links by name (with autocompletion),
- a simple bookmark management system,
- connections using TLS encryption.

Elpher is under active development.  Any suggestions for improvements
are welcome!

Installation
------------

Elpher is available from [MELPA](https://melpa.org).  If you have
never installed packages from this repository before, you'll need
to follow the instructions at https://melpa.org/#/getting-started.

To install Elpher, enter the following:

    M-x package-install RET elpher RET

To uninstall, use `M-x package-delete RET elpher RET`.

Quick Start
-----------

Once installed, use `M-x elpher` to launch the browser.  This will
open a start page which documents the main key bindings and provides
some links to help kick start your exploration of gopherspace.

From here you can move point between links (which may be menu items or
inline URLs in text files) by using `TAB` and `Shift-TAB`,
as in Info.  You can also jump directly to a menu item using `m`, or
use the standard Emacs or Evil motion and search commands to find your
way around.  To open a link, press enter.  (Where a mouse is
available, Clicking on a link with the mouse cursor has the same
effect.)

To return to the page you just followed the link from, press `u`.

Elpher caches (for the duration of an Emacs session) both page contents
and the position of point on each of the pages (gopher menus, query
results, or text pages) you visit, restoring these when you next visit
the same page.  Thus, pressing @key{u} displays the previous page in
exactly the same state as when you left, meaning that you can quickly
and visually explore the different documents in a menu without having to
wait for anything to reload.

Of course, sometimes you'll _want_ to reload the current page
rather than stick with the cached version.  To do this use `R`.
(This is particularly useful for search query results, where this
allows you to perform a different search.)

To customize the various faces Elpher uses, the start page
and a few other odds and ends, use the following:

    M-x customize-group RET elpher RET

Full Documentation
------------------

The full documentation for Elpher can be found in the Info manual,
which should become automatically available if you install Elpher
using `M-x package-install`.  To access it, select it from the root
Info directory which can be displayed using `C-h i`.
